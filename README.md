This is the README file for the Client Project.

*Make sure you have the Server Project downloaded before beginning*

After starting the ServerDriver in the Server Project, right click the ClientGUI in the driver folder and Run As -> Java Application.

A dialog will appear asking for your username, input your username then select Ok.

You are now able to type messages in the input field and chat with other clients on the same server!
